            "* **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\n",
            "* **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.\n",
            "* **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex situations.\n",
            "* **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information (like images, sound, and text).\n",
            "* **Language understanding:** Processing and understanding human language.\n",

            "* **Machine learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This includes subfields like deep learning (using artificial neural networks with multiple layers) and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).\n",
            "* **Natural language processing (NLP):** Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n",
            "* **Computer vision:** Enabling computers to \"see\" and interpret images and videos.\n",
            "* **Robotics:** Combining AI with physical robots to perform tasks in the real world.\n",

Furthermore, there's a distinction between narrow or weak AI (designed for specific tasks) and general or strong AI (hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence across many domains), with the latter still largely in the realm of science fiction.\n",
