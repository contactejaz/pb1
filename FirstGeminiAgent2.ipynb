            "2. **Identify Resource Usage:** Look at the \"CPU,\" \"Memory,\" and \"Disk\" columns.  High percentages (consistently above 80-90%) next to a specific program indicate that it's consuming a lot of resources and could be causing overheating.\n",
            "3. **Identify Suspicious Processes:** Look for processes you don't recognize or that seem unusually active after the Windows update.  These might be related to the update itself or a conflict caused by it.\n",
            "4. **End Tasks (Cautiously):**  If you find a program consuming excessive resources and you're comfortable doing so, right-click on it and select \"End task.\"  **Be cautious!** Ending essential system processes can cause instability.  If you're unsure about a process, leave it alone.  Note the name of the suspicious process before ending it in case you need to search for more information.\n",

Check your laptop's specifications or use a system information tool (search for \"System Information\" in your Windows search bar).\n",
            "2. **Update Your Graphics Driver (if applicable):**  Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers are a common cause of overheating, especially during intensive tasks.\n",
            "    * **For NVIDIA cards:** Go to the NVIDIA website (www.nvidia.com), download the latest drivers for your specific card model, and install them.\n",

            "    * **For integrated graphics:**  You might need to update your chipset drivers. Check your laptop manufacturer's website for the latest drivers for your specific model.  You can also search for them using the Device Manager (explained below).\n",
            "3. **Update Other Drivers (Optional):** While graphics drivers are most likely to cause overheating, updating other drivers (like your network adapter or USB controllers) can sometimes improve overall system stability and performance.\n",
            "4. **Use Device Manager:** Open the Device Manager (search for it in the Windows search bar). Expand each category (like \"Display adapters,\" \"Network adapters,\" etc.) and check for any drivers with a yellow exclamation mark, indicating a problem. Right-click on those and select \"Update driver.\" Windows will try to find the latest drivers automatically.\n",
